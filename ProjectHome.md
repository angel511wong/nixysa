## Nixysa ##
Nixysa is a framework written in Python to automatically generate glue code for NPAPI plugins (plugins for browsers such as [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) or [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)), letting you easily expose C++ classes to Javascript from a simple IDL representation.

Nixysa was originally conceived for the needs of [O3D](http://code.google.com/p/o3d), but is flexible enough to support a wide range of use cases.
