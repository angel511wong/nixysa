# How to contribute code #

We are looking forward to contributions from the rest of the world. Before you submit new code, please take a minute to understand the process.

## Mailing List ##

We currently don't have a separate mailing list for contributors vs users, so please join the [nixysa-users](http://groups.google.com/group/nixysa-users) group. There, feel free to discuss design issues, bug fixes, new features etc. We can help you getting started with the code.

## Submitting code ##

As much as possible, we follow the [Google style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) for C++ code. Please follow that style when writing new code !
All code changes need to be reviewed. To do that we use the same review tool as [Chromium](http://dev.chromium.org/). You can look [here](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/contributing-code) for instructions about how to use that tool.
After the change is uploaded, send it for review to a member of the project. Please ask the nixysa-users list if you don't know how to send it to, someone from the team will be happy to look at it.

## Legal ##

Before we can accept your contributions and check them into the source tree, we need you to sign a Contributor License Agreement which is one of the following:
  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html). This one is easy, you can do it online.
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to Nixysa, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).
